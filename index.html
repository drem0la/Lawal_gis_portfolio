                    <h3>Park Suitability Analysis for Summit County, Utah</h3>
                    <p> A comprehensive GIS-based risk assessment for fire hazards along hiking trails, 
                        focusing on Glacier National Park. Using spatial analysis techniques, multiple environmental factors were considered 
                        including terrain slope, southwest-facing aspects, proximity to water bodies, and vegetation type, to identify areas of high fire potential. 
                        The data were processed from USGS, MRLC Consortium, and National Park Service datasets, using tools like DEM classification, slope analysis, and aspect modeling in ArcGIS Pro. 
                        The final maps visually highlight high-risk areas, offering actionable insights for park management and fire prevention strategies

                    <h3>Assessment of the bicycling environment with deep learning models: Analyzing street view images in Virginia
                    </h3>
                    <p> The biycling environment in Virginia State was evaluated using advanced deep learning models and street-view imagery. The study utilized geotagged panoramic images to classify bike lane types and assess bikeability based on features such as greenery, road conditions, and traffic volume. Models like GPT-4o and BikeLaneNet Classifier were applied to analyze street-level scenes, with GPT-4o achieving 98.29% accuracy and BikeLaneNet Classifier achieving 95% accuracy in distinguishing between shared and separated bike lanes. Scene complexity analysis revealed a balanced distribution of environmental features, including greenery, sky, and road elements.</p>

                    <h3>Modeling Land-Use Change in Loudoun County Using Logistic Regression</h3>
                    <p>Land-use change in Loudoun County, one of the fastest-growing regions in the U.S., was modeled to predict future forest-to-urban transitions. A logistic regression approach was applied to analyze 30-meter resolution spatial data, identifying factors influencing urban expansion from 2010 to 2023. The model utilized three key predictors: elevation, slope, and distance to roads, derived from DEM and TIGER road data. Forest-to-urban transitions were classified as the dependent variable, and random sampling was employed to select a subset of pixels for model development.

                    <h3>Forest fire risk assessment in Glacier National Park, Montana</h3>
                    <p> A fire risk assessment model was developed using GIS to evaluate fire potential in Glacier National Park in Montana. The analysis incorporated multiple environmental variables, including biomass, forest fuel, slope, wind, trails, and proximity to water bodies, to generate a fire risk index. Logical weights were assinged  to these factors, emphasizing the influence of combustible materials. Using ArcGIS Pro, spatial datasets were processed to calculate risk values for each variable and integrated them to produce a composite risk index ranging from 0 to 1. The results were classified into low, medium, and high-risk zones using manual interval classification.</p>

                         that were missed in the 8 wards of Washington D.C. 
                        This analysis covered a period of three months and utilized spatial analysis techniques. 
                        The findings of the study pinpointed the specific wards that required immediate attention
